### Computer Assisted Sacroiliac joint Fixation

A work-in-progress software application developed for a Master's Thesis titled: Proposal of CAOS System for Assisted Navigation on Pelvis Surgery. The application creates a digitally reconstructed radiography (DRR) based on CT DICOM volume data of a pelvis.
The DRR image is then aligned with image registration (WIP) to a reference X-ray image.
